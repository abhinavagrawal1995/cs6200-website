						<p>
							<br />
							This course provides an overview of the important issues in information retrieval, and how
							those issues affect the design and implementation of search engine software. The course
							emphasizes the technology used in Web search engines and the information retrieval theories
							and concepts that underlie all search applications. Mathematical experience including basic
							probability is strongly desirable.

							<h5>Homework</h5>
							<p>There will be several homework assignments. Instructions and due dates will be posted on
								the course website as they are assigned. Some of the problems will be difficult, and it
								will often be helpful to discuss them with others. Feel free to form study groups;
								however, the idea is for everyone to understand the problems and experience working
								through the solutions, so you may not simply "give" a solution to another classmate. In
								particular, each student must write up his or her own homework solutions and must not
								read or copy the solutions of others. If you work with others on a problem, you must
								note with whom you discussed the problem at the beginning of your solution write-up.</p>
							<p>All assignments will be submitted through Git. Please refer to <a href="https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/">this</a> blog for a basic Git tutorial.</p>
							<h5>Projects</h5>
							<p>Up to three projects will be assigned with more extensive programming.</p>

							<h5>Quizzes and Extra Credit</h5>
							<p>We will occasionally have quizzes during lectures. These quizzes are strictly for extra
								credit and are partially meant to measure how well I'm explaining the material.</p>
							<p>Several assignments will also offer extra credit problems.</p>

							<h5>Late policy</h5>
							<p>Assignments should be submitted by 10pm on the announced due date. Late submissions will
								be penalized by 20% per day late.</p>
							<p>You may turn in one assignment late with no penalty during the semester. The penalty will
								automatically be waived for your first late assignment, no questions asked. However, no
								late assignment will be accepted after the beginning of the following lecture.</p>
							<p>If you believe you have a valid reason for turning in an assignment late, please see the
								instructor in advance to obtain full credit.</p>

							<h5>Academic Integrity</h5>
							<p><b>We will be automatically comparing student submissions to search for plagiarism.</b>
								Please ensure that the work you submit is your own. If you're having trouble with the
								material, please ask questions on Piazza or come to our office hours for help. If you
								submit someone else's work as your own, or allow someone else to submit yours, you will
								get zero credit for that assignment and everyone involved will be reported. Please see
								the university's <a href="http://www.northeastern.edu/osccr/academicintegrity/">academic
									integrity policy</a>.</p>
							<p>You may discuss the homework problems or projects with your classmates, the TA, and the
								instructor. You must acknowledge the people with whom you discussed your work, and you
								must write up your own solutions.</p>
							<p>Any written sources used (apart from the text) must also be acknowledged; however, you
								may not consult any solutions from previous years' assignments whether they are student
								or faculty generated.</p>

							<h5>Accommodations for Students with Disabilities</h5>
							<p>If you have a disability-related need for reasonable academic accommodations in this
								course and have not yet met with a Disability Specialist, please visit
								www.northeastern.edu/drc and follow the outlined procedure to request services.</p>
							<p>If the Disability Resource Center has formally approved you for an academic accommodation
								in this class, please present the instructor with your “Professor Notification Letter”
								during the first week of the semester, so that we can address your specific needs as
								early as possible.</p>

							<h4>Grading</h4>
							<p>Grades will be assigned in the following manner:
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Homework – 40%</li>
								<li>Projects – 60%</li>
								<li>Quizzes – up to 10%</li>
							</ul>
