							<br />
							This course provides an overview of the important issues in information retrieval, and how
							those issues affect the design and implementation of search engine software. The course
							emphasizes the technology used in Web search engines and the information retrieval theories
							and concepts that underlie all search applications. Mathematical experience including basic
							probability is strongly desirable.

							<h5>Prerequisites</h5>
							<p>Programming: you should be familiar with programming in an imperative language like Java
								or Python. While the programing language is your choice, we strongly encourage you to
								use one of these two mentioned. If you choose not to use on of these, discuss with the
								instructor first.</a> blog for a basic Git tutorial.</p>
							<h5>Projects</h5>
							<p>Up to three projects will be assigned with more extensive programming.</p>

							<h5>Homework</h5>
							<ul>
								<li>There will be eight assignments (one every two weeks), including programming; please
									see the syllabus for an exact schedule. Some of the problems can be difficult, and
									it will often be helpful to discuss them with others. Feel free to form study
									groups. However, the idea is for everyone to understand the problems and experience
									working through the solutions, so you may not simply "give" a solution to another
									classmate. In particular, each student must write up his or her own homework
									solutions/code and must not read or copy the solutions/code of others. If you work
									with others on a problem, you must note with whom you discussed the problem at the
									beginning of your solution write-up.</li>
								<li>We expect the average total load to be 15 hours/week. Based on past experience, many
									students spend more than 15 hours/week for additional work denoted "Extra Credit";
									the EC can improve your grade, but it is not a replacement for regular credit; EC is
									harder, more time consuming, worth less points, and less discussed during helping
									sessions; it is designed for students who want to get more out of the course. The
									best way, by far, to maximize your grade is to complete the regular credit on time.
								</li>
								<li>Late homework policy: Homework is due on the announced due date. After due date you
									can still demo it for about 5 days, but any change/resubmission is considered late.
								</li>
							</ul>

							<h5>Academic Integrity</h5>
							<p><b>We will be automatically comparing student submissions to search for plagiarism.</b>
								Please ensure that the work you submit is your own. If you're having trouble with the
								material, please ask questions on Piazza or come to our office hours for help. If you
								submit someone else's work as your own, or allow someone else to submit yours, you will
								get zero credit for that assignment and everyone involved will be reported. Please see
								the university's <a href="http://www.northeastern.edu/osccr/academicintegrity/">academic
									integrity policy</a>.</p>
							<p>You may discuss the homework problems or projects with your classmates, the TA, and the
								instructor. You must acknowledge the people with whom you discussed your work, and you
								must write up your own solutions.</p>
							<p>Any written sources used (apart from the text) must also be acknowledged; however, you
								may not consult any solutions from previous years' assignments whether they are student
								or faculty generated.</p>

							<h5>Accommodations for Students with Disabilities</h5>
							<p>If you have a disability-related need for reasonable academic accommodations in this
								course and have not yet met with a Disability Specialist, please visit
								www.northeastern.edu/drc and follow the outlined procedure to request services.</p>
							<p>If the Disability Resource Center has formally approved you for an academic accommodation
								in this class, please present the instructor with your “Professor Notification Letter”
								during the first week of the semester, so that we can address your specific needs as
								early as possible.</p>
